# casino-roulette-wheel
Roulette game simulation using Python:
The player bets on a single number between 0 and 49. While they choose their number, they also choose the amount of money to play.
The script generates a random number in this range (0 - 49), simulating the roulette. If the output number is the same than the number that was chosen,
then the player has won fifty times their bet.
If not, the player loses their bet and can try again in the next round.  
If the user is running out of money, the script stops and displays that they have lost.
